# Thunderstore Team-Viewer

**Do you hate thunderstore defaulting to your first team when you want to choose a different team?**

Well this chrome extention aims to fix that!
Instead of defaulting to your first team when clicking your username, a new dropdown will appear with all of your teams.
Currently the cache updates every 6 hours, meaning it may take a while before a new team you joined is shown.

## How to install

To download follow these steps in order:
1. Download the repository as a `.zip`
2. Extract the files somewhere, preferably not downloads.
3. Go to your browsers extention extention page
4. Turn on developer mode and then load unpacked, select the extracted folder
5. Refresh the thunderstore page
6. Setup complete!

If you have any issues dm me (@atomictyler) to recieve support. I will soon setup a discord for all of my projects.
